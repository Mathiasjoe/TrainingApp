# TrainingApp

The training app is an application that lets you create and store new workouts
to keep track of. This application is a part of a project assignment in the 
system development subject at NTNU Ålesund, created by group 11 consisting 
of six members:
* Berge, Joakim
* Hoelseter, Fredrik
* Jørgensen, Mathias
* Svedal, Kristoffer
* Ulvestad, Odin Velle
* Øvreseth, Mathias Løkkebø

When starting the application, you will be presented with a main window that gives 
you three different buttons.
1. Click on "Your Workouts" to switch to the view workouts scene. Here you will be 
   able to see your saved workouts, as well as create/delete new ones. To create a 
   new workout the application requires you to fill out the three input fields and
   then press the addExercise button. 
2. Click on "Premade Workouts" to switch to the premade workout scene. Here you will
   see a list of premade workouts. It was our intention to add more functionality to
   this scene, but as we were short on time, we had to cut this from production.
3. Click on "Calculator" to switch to the calculator scene. In this scene you will be 
   presented a one-rep maximum calculator that can calculate your maximum single 
   repetition lift.
